# DRF Tutorial Converted to Python 3

## Notes

* Changed __unicode__ to __str__, and omitted u''
* Switched to relative import, I.e.: `from model import ...` becomes `from .models import ...`
* Switched to keeping project settings and application at the same project level, since that seems to be the preferred convention in the Django community
* Stuck to PEP-8 as closely as possible, moving to four space indents, ignoring 79-character line break
